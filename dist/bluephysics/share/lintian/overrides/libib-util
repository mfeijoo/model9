# Upstream distributes this library without a version in the soname. They'd
# like to keep it that way for compatibility with older UDFs (User-defined
# libraries, a type of plugin libraries for Firebird that add custom functions
# in SQL), which could not be recompiled by users (for example due to lost
# sources)
# 
# This causes no problems in Debian, because
#  - the library API/ABI is backwards compatible with the one from previous
#    versions (all the way to 1.0; both server-wise and UDF-wise)
#  - upstream also promises to keep the compatibility in the future
#  - the library will get installed even without .shlibs integration, because
#    any user wanting to use Firebird with his/her shiny UDF will install some
#    firebird server package, and they all depend on libib-util
