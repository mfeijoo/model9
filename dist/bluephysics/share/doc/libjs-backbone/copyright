Comment:
 Source lacks licensing, but is clearly derived from
 <https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/blob/master/src/styles/github.css>
 and licensing is assumed to be same as generally for that project
 <https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/blob/master/LICENSE>, which
 (unchanged since addition og github.css file in 2009) contains
 BSD-3-Clause.
