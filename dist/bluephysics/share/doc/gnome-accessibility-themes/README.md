GNOME Extra Themes
==================

This module houses themes and theme-y tidbits that don’t really fit in anywhere
else, or deserve their own module. At the moment this consists of:

 * The GTK+ 2 version of Adwaita
 * Adwaita-dark as a separate theme, along with its GTK+ 2 equivalent
 * GTK+ 2 versions of the HighContrast themes
 * The legacy HighContrast icon theme
 * Index files needed for Adwaita to be used outside of GNOME

Once named `gnome-themes-standard`, this module used to contain various
components of the default GNOME 3 theme. However, at this point, most it has
moved elsewhere. The GTK+ 3 versions of the Adwaita and HighContrast themes are
now part of GTK+ 3 itself, and the HighContrastInverse and LowContrast themes
have been discontinued.

Not to be confused with `gnome-themes-extras`.

How to report bugs
------------------

You can report issues you find on GNOME’s [GitLab][1], or chat about them on
[IRC][2], in [#gnome-design][3].

But please, if you are experiencing issues with the default GTK+ 3 themes,
report them [over at GTK+][4].
