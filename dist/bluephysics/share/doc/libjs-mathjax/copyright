License: OFL-1.1
   SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE
   Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
   .
   PREAMBLE
   The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
   development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
   efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
   open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
   with others.
   .
   The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
   redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
   fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
   redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
   names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
   however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
   requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
   to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
   .
   DEFINITIONS
   "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
   Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
   include source files, build scripts and documentation.
   .
   "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
   copyright statement(s).
   .
   "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
   distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
   .
   "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
   or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the
   Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
   new environment.
   .
   "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
   writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
   .
   PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
   Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
   a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
   redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
   Software, subject to the following conditions:
   .
   1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
   in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
   .
   2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
   redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
   contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
   included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
   in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
   binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
   .
   3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
   Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
   Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
   presented to the users.
   .
   4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
   Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
   Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
   Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
   permission.
   .
   5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
   must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
   distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
   remain under this license does not apply to any document created
   using the Font Software.
   .
   TERMINATION
   This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
   not met.
   .
   DISCLAIMER
   THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
   OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
   COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
   DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
   FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM
   OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

License: GFL
   GUST FONT LICENSE
   .
   This is a preliminary version (2006-09-30), barring acceptance from
   the LaTeX Project Team and other feedback, of the GUST Font License.
   (GUST is the Polish TeX Users Group, http://www.gust.org.pl)
   .
   For the most recent version of this license see
   http://www.gust.org.pl/fonts/licenses/GUST-FONT-LICENSE.txt
   or
   http://tug.org/fonts/licenses/GUST-FONT-LICENSE.txt
   .
   This work may be distributed and/or modified under the conditions
   of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3c of this
   license or (at your option) any later version.
   .
   Please also observe the following clause:
   1) it is requested, but not legally required, that derived works be
      distributed only after changing the names of the fonts comprising this
      work and given in an accompanying "manifest", and that the
      files comprising the Work, as listed in the manifest, also be given
      new names. Any exceptions to this request are also given in the
      manifest.
   .
      We recommend the manifest be given in a separate file named
      MANIFEST-<fontid>.txt, where <fontid> is some unique identification
      of the font family. If a separate "readme" file accompanies the Work,
      we recommend a name of the form README-<fontid>.txt.
   .
   The latest version of the LaTeX Project Public License is in
   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt and version 1.3c or later
   is part of all distributions of LaTeX version 2006/05/20 or later.
