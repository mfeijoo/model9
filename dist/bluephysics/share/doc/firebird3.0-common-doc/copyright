Comment:
 What is removed from upstream source and why
 ============================================
 * Bundled libraries
 .
 The following libraries are supplied by upstream in their source
 tarball. These are present in Debian and using the Debian packages is
 better because:
  - improved security: no need to watch the bundled libraries for
    security problems -- Debian Security already handles that for the
    Debian packages
  - get fixes and improvements automatically when the Debian library
    package is upgraded
  - the source tarball decreases in size from 13MB to 7.5MB (42% decrease)
 Removed library sources:
  - extern/editline
  - src/include/firebird/impl/boost
  - extern/libtommath
 .
 * Removed sources with non-free/missing licensing
 .
 The following files are removed as they contain only copyright
 information without any license allowing their distribution. Luckily,
 they are not needed when building on Debiian.
 .
  - builds/install/arch-specific/solaris/
  - src/msgs/templates.sql
  - extern/SfIO/
 .
 * Generated files without source
 .
 These files are generated from sources not included in the upstream tarball.
 .
  - doc/Firebird-3-QuickStart.pdf
  - doc/ReleaseNotes.pdf
  - doc/README.SecureRemotePassword.html
 .
 * Generated files and other cruft.
 .
 Repackaging is a good opportunity to also remove the following files, which 
 are generated during the build:
 .
  - configure
  - builds/make.new/config/config.guess
  - builds/make.new/config/config.h.in
  - builds/make.new/config/config.sub
  - builds/make.new/config/install-sh
  - builds/make.new/config/ltmain.sh
 .
 Also, the following files are just cruft and are present in the upstream 
 tarball by mistake:
  - .cvsignore (in several directories)

Comment:
 Years of copyright after 2000 are uncertain. Sources point to CVS for the 
 exact dates. Upstream CVS repository is at 
 <http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=9028>. That was later converted to 
 Subversion, then to Git and is currently avaiilable at 
 <https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird.git>. The years above are as present 
 in the source.

Comment:
 Years of copyright after 2000 are uncertain. Sources point to CVS for the 
 exact dates. Upstream CVS repository is at 
 <http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=9028>. That was later converted to 
 Subversion, then to Git and is currently avaiilable at 
 <https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird.git>. The years above are as present 
 in the source.

 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
 3.1. Application of License.
 .
 The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
 by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The
 Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms
 of this License or a future version of this License released under Section
 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
 Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
 Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
 License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
 additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
 .
 3.2. Availability of Source Code.
 .
 Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
 available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the
 same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
 Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
 available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
 must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
 initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
 version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
 recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
 remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
 maintained by a third party.
 .
 3.3. Description of Modifications.
 .
 You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
 documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date
 of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification
 is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the
 Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in
 (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or
 related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
 Covered Code.
 .
 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
 .
 (a) Third Party Claims.
 .
 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
 intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by
 such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text
 file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the
 claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
 will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
 Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor
 shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes
 available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
 appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform
 those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
 .
 (b) Contributor APIs.
 .
 If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface
 and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably
 necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this
 information in the LEGAL file.
 .
 (c) Representations.
 .
 Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
 above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
 Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights
 to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
 .
 3.5. Required Notices.
 .
 You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.
 If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file
 due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such
 as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a
 notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as
 a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate
 this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe
 recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may
 choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
 liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,
 You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
 Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any
 such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
 alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
 Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
 Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
 You offer.
 .
 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
 .
 You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements
 of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include
 a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is
 available under the terms of this License, including a description of how
 and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must
 be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
 documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating
 to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
 Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain
 terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with
 the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version
 does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code
 version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the 
 Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely
 clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, 
 not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
 indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
 incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
 such terms You offer.
 .
 3.7. Larger Works.
 .
 You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
 governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
 single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
 License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
 with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
 order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
 License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
 the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
 described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the
 Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
 description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill
 to be able to understand it.
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
 This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
 notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
 .
 6. Versions of the License.
 .
 6.1. New Versions.
 .
 Inprise Corporation (''Inprise'') may publish revised and/or new versions of
 the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
 version number.
 .
 6.2. Effect of New Versions.
 .
 Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
 License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version.
 You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any
 subsequent version of the License published by Inprise. No one other than
 Inprise has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
 under this License.
 .
 6.3. Derivative Works.
 .
 If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only
 do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed
 by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases
 ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL", ''NPL", 
 "InterBase", "Inprise", "Borland'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not
 appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this
 License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
 contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape
 Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original
 Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
 themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
 .
 6.4 Origin of the InterBase Public License.
 .
 The InterBase public license is based on the Mozilla Public License V 1.1
 with the following changes:
 .
 1. The license is published by Inprise Corporation. Only Inprise Corporation
 can modify the terms applicable to Covered Code.
 2. The license can be modified and used for code which is not already
 governed by this license. Modified versions of the license must be renamed
 to avoid confusion with Netscape?s or Inprise?s license and must include a
 description of changes from the InterBase Public License.
 3. The name of the license in Exhibit A is the "InterBase Public License".
 4. The reference to an alternative license in Exhibit A has been removed.
 5. Amendments I, II, III, V, and VI have been deleted.
 6. Exhibit A, Netscape Public License has been deleted
 7. A new amendment (II) has been added, describing the required and
 restricted rights to use the trademarks of Inprise Corporation.

 WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
 MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE
 RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
 SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
 DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
 SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
 ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
 HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8. TERMINATION.
 .
 8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
 breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to
 the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination
 of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
 beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
 .
 8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
 (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
 Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such
 action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:
 .
 (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
 any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under
 Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
 Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt
 of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
 agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications
 made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect
 to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of
 notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed
 upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the
 rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period
 specified above.
 .
 (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
 Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
 rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b)
 are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed,
 or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.
 .
 8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
 that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
 any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
 prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
 reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections
 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of
 any payment or license.
 .
 8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end
 user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have
 been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
 shall survive termination.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
 NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
 OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
 ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE
 OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF
 SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
 PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
 APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
 THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
 The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48
 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and
 ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48
 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
 acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
 .
 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
 .
 This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
 hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
 provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
 enforceable. This License shall be governed by Georgia law provisions (except
 to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
 conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
 party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business
 in the United States of America, Any litigation relating to this License
 shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
 District of Georgia and/or the state courts of Gwinnett County, Georgia,
 with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation,
 court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of
 the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
 Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the
 language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
 apply to this License.
 .
 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 .
 As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
 for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
 utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
 Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
 basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
 admission of liability.
 .
 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
 .
 Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
 "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer
 permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of
 the InterBase Public License or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
 by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

 (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date 
 Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code. 
 .
 (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted:
 .
 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor 
 Version; 
 .
 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 
 .
 3) for infringements caused by: 
 .
 i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or 
 .
 ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with

 .
 .
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
 .
 3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which 
 You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without 
 limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be 
 distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this 
 License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this 
 License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer 
 or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the 
 applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, 
 You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described 
 in Section 3.5. 
 .
 .
 3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to 
 which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the 
 terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via 
 an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made 
 an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution 
 Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the 
 date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent 
 version of that particular Modification has been made available to such 
 recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version 
 remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by 
 a third party. 
 .
 .
 3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to 
 which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to 
 create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a 
 prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from 
 Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the 
 Initial Developer in 
 .
 (a) the Source Code, and
 .
 (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in 
 which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 .
 .
 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
 .
 a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under 
 a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the 
 rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, 
 Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution 
 titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim 
 in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If 
 Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made 
 available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify 
 the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and 
 shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or 
 newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the 
 Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. 
 .
 (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application 
 programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent 
 licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, 
 Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 
 .
 .
 (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed 
 pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's 
 Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor 
 has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 
 .
 .
 3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file 
 of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source 
 Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location 
 (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a 
 notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as 
 a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this 
 License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe 
 recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may 
 choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
 liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You 
 may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer 
 or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, 
 support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You 
 hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
 liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
 warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 
 .
 .
 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered 
 Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been 
 met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source 
 Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, 
 including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of 
 Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an 
 Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe 
 recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the 
 Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of 
 Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided 
 that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and hat the license 
 for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights 
 in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You 
 distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it 
 absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by 
 You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to 
 indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by 
 the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You 
 offer. 
 .
 .
 3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered 
 Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute 
 the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the 
 requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 
 .
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect 
 to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You 
 must: 
 .
 (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and 
 .
 (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be 
 included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with 
 all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute 
 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of 
 ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 
 .
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
 .
 This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in 
 Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. 
 .
 .
 6. Versions of the License.
 .
 .
 6.1. New Versions. The Initial Developer of this code may publish revised 
 and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be 
 given a distinguishing version number. 
 .
 .
 6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under 
 a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under 
 the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code 
 under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the 
 Initial Developer. No one other than the Initial Developer has the right to modify 
 the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
 .
 .
 6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License 
 (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already 
 Covered Code governed by this License), You must 
 .
 (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', 
 ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL", ''NPL", or any confusingly similar phrases 
 do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs 
 from this License) and 
 .
 (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains 
 terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public 
 License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or 
 Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves 
 be deemed to be modifications of this License.) 
 .
 .
 6.4 Origin of the Initial Developer's Public License. The Initial Developer's 
 Public License is based on the Mozilla Public License V 1.1 with the following 
 changes: 
 .
 1) The license is published by the Initial Developer of this code. Only the 
 Initial Developer can modify the terms applicable to Covered Code. 
 .
 2) The license can be modified and used for code which is not already 
 governed by this license. Modified versions of the license must be 
 renamed to avoid confusion with Netscape's license Initial Developer's's 
 license and must include a description of changes from the Initial 
 Developer's Public License. 
 .
 3) The name of the license in Exhibit A is the "Initial Developer's Public 
 License".
 .
 4) The reference to an alternative license in Exhibit A has been removed.
 .
 5) Amendments I, II, III, V, and VI have been deleted.
 .
 6) Exhibit A, Netscape Public License has been deleted

 .
 .

 automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such 
 breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the 
 Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this 
 License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the 
 termination of this License shall survive. .
 8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding 
 declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial 
 Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as 
 "Participant") alleging that:
 .
 (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes 
 any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You 
 under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice 
 from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after 
 receipt of notice You either:
 .
 (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable 
 reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications 
 made by such Participant, or 
 .
 (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor 
 Version against such Participant. 
 .
 .
 If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment 
 arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or 
 the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to 
 You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the 
 expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. 
 .
 (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's 
 Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any 
 rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 
 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, 
 distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. 
 .
 8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that 
 such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent 
 where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the 
 initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the 
 licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken 
 into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 
 .
 8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user

 validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall 
 survive termination. 
 .
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
 .
 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT 
 (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL 
 DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED 
 CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON 
 FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY 
 CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF 
 GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY 
 AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY 
 SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS 
 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR 
 PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT

 ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
 DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

 .
 .
