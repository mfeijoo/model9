Upstream-Name: Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J)
Source: http://www.slf4j.org/dist/
Comment:
    The upstream supplied source package contains binary jar files and
    pre-built documentation, and hence upstream sources have been
    repackaged. Please use the get-orig-source target from
    debian/rules to create the orig.tar.gz used for Debian
    packaging. For more details on repackaging of upstream sources
    please see the debian/orig-tar.sh file.
