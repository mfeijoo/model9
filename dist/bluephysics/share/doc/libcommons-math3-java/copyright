  The resolution engine is a simple translation of the MINPACK
  <http://www.netlib.org/minpack/lmder.f> routine with minor
  changes. The changes include the over-determined resolution and the Q.R.
  decomposition which has been rewritten following the algorithm described in the
  P. Lascaux and R. Theodor book "Analyse numérique matricielle
  appliquée à l'art de l'ingénieur", Masson 1986. The
  redistribution policy for MINPACK is available
