    This project builds the JavaMail "mailapi.jar" file.  This jar file
    contains a fully operational JavaMail implementation but without any
    protocol providers.  It can be used with the separate protocol provider
    jar files (e.g., smtp.jar, imap.jar) to provide a full JavaMail runtime
    implementation.
